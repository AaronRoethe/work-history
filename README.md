# Work History

Chronological record of pull request activity across GitHub Enterprise (git.taservs.net).

Each commit represents one PR — merged, closed, or open — backdated to match
the real merge/close date. The commit message carries key metadata: repo, state,
lines changed, file count, commits, and review activity.

## Structure

```
activity/
  YYYY.md   — all PRs for that year, appended chronologically
README.md   — this file
```
