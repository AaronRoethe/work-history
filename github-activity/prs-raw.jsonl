The function returns early with an error but this path is never exercised, meaning malformed messages from other producers would cause unhandled behavior.\n- No test covers proto.Unmarshal failing when the cloud event payload contains invalid or corrupted protobuf bytes. This is a real production risk when upstream producers send malformed data, and the error path is untested.\n- The error path where the fastlaneindexsvc gRPC address is empty (addr == \"\") is not tested. The existing TestParse only calls cfg.LoadEnvFromPath and never actually invokes Parse(), leaving configureFastLaneIndexSvcClient's missing-address error branch completely uncovered.\n\n---\n*Generated by pr-behavior-reviewer*","changedFiles":107,"closedAt":null,"comments":{"totalCount":9},"commits":{"totalCount":1},"createdAt":"2026-02-24T21:18:50Z","deletions":14965,"headRefName":"aroethe/delete-ibrsubmission","labels":{"nodes":[]},"mergedAt":null,"number":14947,"repository":{"name":"zeke","nameWithOwner":"rcom/zeke","owner":{"login":"rcom"}},"reviews":{"totalCount":0},"state":"OPEN","title":"chore(ais): delete ibrsubmissionsvc artifacts from zeke","url":"https://git.taservs.net/rcom/zeke/pull/14947"}

{"additions":464,"baseRefName":"master","body":"## Problem\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://taserintl.atlassian.net/browse/RMS-101303\r\n\r\nSoftDeleteSubmission was OOMKilling pods for agencies with large submissions\r\n(Kent PD ~58k docs, Baton Rouge ~110k docs). The handler loaded all IBR documents\r\nfor a submission into a single Go slice before processing, causing ~100MB peak\r\nmemory usage — exceeding the pod memory limit.\r\n\r\nHermes retried 3 times, hitting 3 different pods, all OOMKilled. The operation\r\nappeared to hang from the caller's perspective.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nReplace the unbounded document fetch with LIMIT/OFFSET pagination inside a\r\nsingle transaction. Peak memory is now bounded to one page (~8.5MB at\r\nDocumentPageSize=5000) regardless of submission size.\r\n\r\n**Key changes:**\r\n- `getIBRDocumentsForSubmissionPage` (new) — replaces unbounded batch fetch,\r\n  uses `ORDER BY id LIMIT ? OFFSET ?` for stable pagination\r\n- `SoftDeleteSubmissions` — runs the submission UPDATE once, then loops pages\r\n  calling `softDeleteSubmissionInternal` per page\r\n- `softDeleteSubmissionInternal` — unchanged in signature; now processes one\r\n  page at a time instead of the full document set\r\n- `DocumentPageSize = 5000` — declared as `var` (not `const`) to allow test override\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n**Unit tests** (`sqlstore/sqlstore_submission_test.go`):\r\n- `TestSoftDeleteSubmissions_MarksSubmissionDeleted`\r\n- `TestSoftDeleteSubmissions_CreatesUnsubmittedCopies`\r\n- `TestSoftDeleteSubmissions_SkipsExistingUnsubmittedCopies`\r\n- `TestSoftDeleteSubmissions_ProcessesMultiplePages` — overrides\r\n  `DocumentPageSize=2`, creates 5 docs, verifies all 5 copies across 3 pages\r\n\r\n**Manual tests** (`tests/manual/`):\r\n- `seed_large_submission.sql` — seeds 60,000-doc submission (12 full pages)\r\n- `test_with_grpcurl.sh` — runs SoftDeleteSubmission and verifies DB state\r\n  (`submission.deleted=1`, 60k unsubmitted copies created)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd tests/manual\r\n\r\n# 1.

Cut Release Branches (`cut-release-branches.yaml`)\r\n\r\n**Purpose**: Creates release branches from the current codebase state.\r\n\r\n**Triggers**:\r\n- **Manual**: `workflow_dispatch` with optional inputs:\r\n  - `branches`: Comma-separated list of branch names (defaults to `releases/release-YYYY-MM-DD`)\r\n  - `target-revision`: SHA or branch name to cut from (defaults to current HEAD)\r\n- **Scheduled**: Every Friday at 2 PM Pacific Time\r\n  - Only runs if the most recent release branch is at least 10 days old\r\n  - Can be skipped by setting `SKIP_RELEASE_BRANCH` variable to `true`\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n- Automatically generates branch name with current date if not provided\r\n- Validates that existing release branches are old enough before creating new ones\r\n- Uses GitHub App authentication for branch creation\r\n\r\n**Branch Naming Convention**: `releases/release-YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `releases/release-2024-01-15`)\r\n\r\n**Required Variables/Secrets**:\r\n- `vars.AIS_GH_APP_ID` - GitHub App ID\r\n- `secrets.AIS_GH_APP_KEY` - GitHub App private key\r\n- `vars.SLACK_RELEASE_CHANNEL` - Slack channel for notifications (optional)\r\n- `vars.SKIP_RELEASE_BRANCH` - Flag to skip scheduled branch creation (optional)\r\n\r\n### 2. Create PreRelease (`create-prerelease.yaml`)\r\n\r\n**Purpose**: Automatically creates a pre-release when code is pushed to a release branch.\r\n\r\n**Triggers**:\r\n- **Push**: Automatically triggered when code is pushed to any branch matching `releases/release*`\r\n\r\n**Version Format**: `YYYYMMDD.RUN_NUMBER-release-YYYY-MM-DD`\r\n\r\n**Example**: `20240115.123-release-2024-01-15`\r\n- `20240115` - Date in YYYYMMDD format\r\n- `123` - GitHub Actions run number\r\n- `release-2024-01-15` - Release branch suffix\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n- Generates unique version numbers using timestamp, run number, and branch name\r\n- Creates pre-release (not a full release) using `axon-actions/trunk-based-development@v1`\r\n- Uses GitHub App authentication for release creation\r\n\r\n**Required Variables/Secrets**:\r\n- `vars.AIS_GH_APP_ID` - GitHub App ID\r\n- `secrets.AIS_GH_APP_KEY` - GitHub App private key\r\n\r\n**Important**: This workflow creates a **pre-release**, which triggers the `prereleased` event that the Staging workflow listens for.\r\n\r\n### 3. Staging (`staging.yaml`)\r\n\r\n**Purpose**: Deploys the application to the staging environment when a pre-release is created.\r\n\r\n**Triggers**:\r\n- **Release Event**: `prereleased` - Triggered when a pre-release is created\r\n- **Release Event**: `edited` - Triggered when a pre-release is manually edited\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n- Uses reusable workflow from `axon-actions/ais-ci-templates`\r\n- Inherits all secrets from the calling workflow\r\n- Uses contract file `.github/config/ci.yaml` for configuration\r\n\r\n**Important**: This workflow must listen for `release` events with type `prereleased`, NOT `push` events. This is critical for the workflow chain to function correctly.\r\n\r\n### 4. Production (`production.yaml`)\r\n\r\n**Purpose**: Deploys the application to the production environment when a pre-release is promoted to a full release.\r\n\r\n**Triggers**:\r\n- **Release Event**: `released` - Triggered when a pre-release is manually promoted to a full release in GitHub\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n- Uses reusable workflow from `axon-actions/ais-ci-templates`\r\n- Inherits all secrets from the calling workflow\r\n- Only triggers on full releases (not pre-releases)\r\n\r\n**Promotion Process**: \r\n1. Go to the GitHub Releases page\r\n2. Find the pre-release you want to promote\r\n3. Click \"Edit\" and uncheck \"Set as a pre-release\"\r\n4. Save - this will trigger the `released` event\r\n\r\n## Common Workflows\r\n\r\n### Creating a New Release (Manual)\r\n\r\n1. **Cut Release Branch**:\r\n   - Go to Actions → \"Cut Release Branches\"\r\n   - Click \"Run workflow\"\r\n   - Optionally specify:\r\n     - Branch name(s): `releases/release-2024-01-15`\r\n     - Target revision: SHA or branch name (defaults to current HEAD)\r\n   - Click \"Run workflow\"\r\n\r\n2. **Push to Release Branch** (if needed):\r\n   - The release branch is created automatically\r\n   - If you need to make changes, push commits to the release branch\r\n   - This automatically triggers the Create PreRelease workflow\r\n\r\n3. **Pre-Release Created**:\r\n   - The Create PreRelease workflow runs automatically\r\n   - A pre-release is created with version format: `YYYYMMDD.RUN_NUMBER-release-YYYY-MM-DD`\r\n   - The Staging workflow is automatically triggered\r\n\r\n4. **Staging Deployment**:\r\n   - The Staging workflow runs automatically\r\n   - Application is deployed to staging environment\r\n   - Test the application in staging\r\n\r\n5. **Promote to Production** (when ready):\r\n   - Go to GitHub Releases page\r\n   - Find the pre-release\r\n   - Click \"Edit\" and uncheck \"Set as a pre-release\"\r\n   - Save - this triggers Production deployment\r\n\r\n### Scheduled Release Creation\r\n\r\nThe workflow automatically creates release branches every Friday at 2 PM Pacific Time, but only if:\r\n- The most recent release branch is at least 10 days old\r\n- `SKIP_RELEASE_BRANCH` variable is not set to `true`\r\n\r\nIf these conditions are met, a new release branch is created automatically, which will trigger the pre-release creation and staging deployment.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Staging Workflow Not Triggering\r\n\r\n**Problem**: Pre-release is created but staging deployment doesn't run.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Ensure `staging.yaml` is configured to listen for `release` events with type `prereleased`, not `push` events:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\non:\r\n  release:\r\n    types:\r\n      - prereleased\r\n      - edited\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOT**:\r\n```yaml\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - \"release*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pre-Release Not Created\r\n\r\n**Problem**: Pushing to release branch doesn't create a pre-release.\r\n\r\n**Possible Causes**:\r\n1. Branch name doesn't match pattern `releases/release*`\r\n2. GitHub App credentials are missing or invalid\r\n3. Workflow file has syntax errors\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Check the Actions tab for workflow run errors and verify branch naming matches the pattern.\r\n\r\n### Production Deployment Not Triggering\r\n\r\n**Problem**: Promoting pre-release to full release doesn't trigger production.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: \r\n1. Verify the release was actually promoted (uncheck \"Set as a pre-release\")\r\n2. Check that `production.yaml` listens for `released` event type\r\n3. Check Actions tab for any workflow errors\r\n\r\n## Version Number Format\r\n\r\nRelease versions follow this format:\r\n```\r\nYYYYMMDD.RUN_NUMBER-release-YYYY-MM-DD\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- `YYYYMMDD` - Date in UTC when the workflow ran\r\n- `RUN_NUMBER` - GitHub Actions run number for that workflow\r\n- `release-YYYY-MM-DD` - The release branch name suffix\r\n\r\n**Example**: `20240115.123-release-2024-01-15`\r\n\r\nThis format ensures:\r\n- Unique version numbers for each release\r\n- Traceability back to the specific workflow run\r\n- Clear association with the release branch\r\n\r\n## Required Configuration\r\n\r\n### GitHub Variables\r\n- `AIS_GH_APP_ID` - GitHub App ID for authentication\r\n- `SLACK_RELEASE_CHANNEL` - Slack channel for notifications (optional)\r\n- `SKIP_RELEASE_BRANCH` - Set to `true` to skip scheduled branch creation (optional)\r\n\r\n### GitHub Secrets\r\n- `AIS_GH_APP_KEY` - GitHub App private key for authentication\r\n\r\n### Repository Settings\r\n- Self-hosted runners must be configured for the workflows to run\r\n- GitHub App must have appropriate permissions to create branches and releases\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. **Test in Staging First**: Always verify the pre-release works correctly in staging before promoting to production\r\n2. **Monitor Workflow Runs**: Check the Actions tab to ensure each step completes successfully\r\n3. **Use Descriptive Branch Names**: Follow the `releases/release-YYYY-MM-DD` convention for consistency\r\n4. **Review Pre-Releases**: Before promoting, review the pre-release notes and verify all changes are correct\r\n5. **Keep Release Branches Clean**: Avoid unnecessary commits to release branches after they're created\r\n\r\n## Related Files\r\n\r\n- `.github/workflows/cut-release-branches.yaml` - Release branch creation workflow\r\n- `.github/workflows/create-prerelease.yaml` - Pre-release creation workflow\r\n- `.github/workflows/staging.yaml` - Staging deployment workflow\r\n- `.github/workflows/production.yaml` - Production deployment workflow\r\n- `.github/config/ci.yaml` - CI/CD configuration contract file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relevant Links\r\n\r\n- [Jira Ticket](https://taserintl.atlassian.net/browse/RMS-95479) - Required\r\n- [PM Spec](https://axon.quip.com) - Optional, if already linked in related work items\r\n- [Design Doc](https://axon.quip.com) - If applicable\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n- [ ] This PR is safe to be merged independently of other PRs (If the author doesn't know, please leave a comment in the PR and ask for help from the reviewers)\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on other PRs and/or JIRA tickets in same or other repos\r\n\r\n    - [ ] If any necessary prerequisite is not yet merged, set this PR to draft\r\n    - [ ] All dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\n\r\n- [Related _repoName_ PR](https://git.taservs.net/integrations/\u003crepo\u003e/pull/\u003cnumber\u003e) - adjust link and link text appropriately\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n","changedFiles":2,"closedAt":"2025-11-13T22:54:11Z","comments":{"totalCount":3},"commits":{"totalCount":3},"createdAt":"2025-11-13T22:04:06Z","deletions":44,"headRefName":"aroethe/branch-cut-fix","labels":{"nodes":[{"name":"violate-security-policy"}]},"mergedAt":"2025-11-13T22:54:11Z","number":113,"repository":{"name":"autoDLQ","nameWithOwner":"integrations/autoDLQ","owner":{"login":"integrations"}},"reviews":{"totalCount":3},"state":"MERGED","title":"fix(ais): branch-cut workflows","url":"https://git.taservs.net/integrations/autoDLQ/pull/113"}

{"additions":495,"baseRefName":"master","body":"## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the `listIbrSubmissions` GraphQL query by adding a new `documents` field that provides rich document metadata for each submission. This eliminates the need for separate API calls to fetch document details, improving developer experience while maintaining performance flexibility.\r\n\r\n## ✨ Key Features Added\r\n\r\n### 1. Documents Field Resolution\r\n- **New GraphQL Field**: `documents: [IbrDocument!]` on `IbrSubmission` type\r\n- **Lazy Loading**: Documents are only fetched when the field is requested in GraphQL queries\r\n- **Automatic Filtering**: Returns only documents that belong to each submission (via `documentIds`)\r\n\r\n### 2. Enhanced Document Schema\r\n- **Extended `IbrDocument` type** with new metadata fields:\r\n  - `documentFriendlyId: String`\r\n  - `documentCreatedDate: Date`\r\n  - `occurrenceDate: Date` \r\n  - `authorId: String`\r\n  - `sequenceId: String`\r\n\r\n### 3. Performance Optimization\r\n- **`skipDocuments` Parameter**: Optional field argument to avoid expensive document fetching\r\n  ```graphql\r\n  documents(skipDocuments: Boolean): [IbrDocument!]\r\n  ```\r\n- **Smart Field Resolver**: Only executes when documents are actually requested\r\n- **Client-side Filtering**: Efficiently filters results by submission's `documentIds`\r\n\r\n## 🔄 Data Flow\r\n\r\n```\r\nFrontend GraphQL Query\r\n         ↓\r\nlistIbrSubmissions Query Resolver\r\n         ↓  \r\nIbrSubmissionClient.listIbrSubmissions()\r\n         ↓\r\nResponse Transform (documents: undefined)\r\n         ↓\r\nGraphQL Response with submissions\r\n         ↓\r\nWhen documents field is requested...\r\n         ↓\r\nIbrSubmission.documents Field Resolver\r\n         ↓\r\nIbrSubmissionClient.listIbrDocuments() + filtering\r\n         ↓\r\nFull IbrDocument objects returned\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Usage Examples\r\n\r\n### Performance Mode (Skip Documents):\r\n```graphql\r\nquery listIbrSubmission(\r\n  $limit: Int,\r\n  $offset: Int,\r\n  $filter: ListIbrSubmissionsFilter\r\n) {\r\n  listIbrSubmissions(\r\n    limit: $limit,\r\n    offset: $offset,\r\n    filter: $filter\r\n  ) {\r\n    results {\r\n      id,\r\n      documentIds,\r\n      rmsDocumentIds,\r\n      submissionResults {\r\n        id,\r\n        payloadId,\r\n        errorId,\r\n        submissionId,\r\n        status\r\n      },\r\n      incidentDateTo\r\n      documents {\r\n        documentCreatedDate\r\n        documentFriendlyId\r\n        incidentId\r\n    \t\tincidentFriendlyId\r\n        incidentDate\r\n        finalizedOn\r\n        canBeSubmittedToNibrs\r\n        isNibrsCompliant\r\n        occurrenceDate\r\n        authorId\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    totalResults\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample output: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"listIbrSubmissions\": {\r\n      \"results\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"018e8de9-a2c6-44c7-923e-7df7b2146399\",\r\n          \"documentIds\": [\r\n            \"ffff685e-1664-413b-855a-400bf7c3068e\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"rmsDocumentIds\": [\r\n            \"5de53500-a8ad-408c-ac9c-ec6b773c3ec4\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"submissionResults\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"id\": \"ef48bc2e-97ef-476c-bfd3-fdc75ece936b\",\r\n              \"payloadId\": \"\",\r\n              \"errorId\": \"32f829ff-bffa-444a-8143-5ad8d64d90d7\",\r\n              \"submissionId\": \"018e8de9-a2c6-44c7-923e-7df7b2146399\",\r\n              \"status\": \"SUCCESS\"\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          \"incidentDateTo\": \"2021-08-11T07:00:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"documents\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"documentCreatedDate\": null,\r\n              \"documentFriendlyId\": \"\",\r\n              \"incidentId\": \"7f2009ee-6343-4a84-ab49-01112a5377fd\",\r\n              \"incidentFriendlyId\": \"ATzvhoraejnfqycfackjyvrl\",\r\n              \"incidentDate\": \"2019-04-29T05:35:00.000Z\",\r\n              \"finalizedOn\": \"2024-09-21T05:26:02.000Z\",\r\n              \"canBeSubmittedToNibrs\": false,\r\n              \"isNibrsCompliant\": false,\r\n              \"occurrenceDate\": null,\r\n              \"authorId\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"documentCreatedDate\": null,\r\n              \"documentFriendlyId\": \"\",\r\n              \"incidentId\": \"7f2009ee-6343-4a84-ab49-01112a5377fd\",\r\n              \"incidentFriendlyId\": \"ATzvhoraejnfqycfackjyvrl\",\r\n              \"incidentDate\": \"2022-03-22T12:38:35.299Z\",\r\n              \"finalizedOn\": \"2024-01-10T18:12:56.000Z\",\r\n              \"canBeSubmittedToNibrs\": false,\r\n              \"isNibrsCompliant\": false,\r\n              \"occurrenceDate\": null,\r\n              \"authorId\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"totalResults\": 1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🧪 Testing Coverage\r\n\r\n- ✅ **22/22 unit tests passing**\r\n- ✅ **Complete field resolver testing** (empty case, filtering case, skip case)\r\n- ✅ **Response transformation testing** for new document fields\r\n- ✅ **Mock data updated** with realistic test values\r\n- ✅ **Error handling** and edge case coverage\r\n\r\n## ⚡ Performance Considerations\r\n\r\n### Current Implementation:\r\n- Fetches all documents when `documents` field is requested\r\n- Filters client-side by submission's `documentIds`\r\n- Includes `skipDocuments` option for performance-critical queries\r\n\r\n### Future Optimizations (when backend ready):\r\n- Backend `documentIds` filtering support\r\n- DataLoader for N+1 query elimination\r\n- Pagination support for large document sets\r\n\r\n## 📁 Files Modified\r\n\r\n### GraphQL Schema \u0026 Types\r\n- `src/gql/types/fields/ibrSubmission.ts` -

{"additions":848,"baseRefName":"master","body":"## 📋 Summary\r\nThis PR integrates the IBRSubmissionSvc with the Records Service via `getBatchDocument` calls and extends the `ibr_document` table to store additional document metadata extracted from Records Service responses.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Key Changes\r\n\r\n### 📡 Records Service Integration via `getBatchDocument`\r\n\r\n**Modified Methods:**\r\n- `NotifyIBRDocument()` - Now calls `getBatchDocument()` to fetch document data before storing\r\n- `NotifyExportIntegrationsDocument()` - Enhanced with document field extraction\r\n\r\n**New Document Field Extraction:**\r\n```go\r\n// New method: extractDocumentFields()\r\nfunc (s *IBRSubmissionSvc) extractDocumentFields(\r\n    ctx rms.Ctx, \r\n    documentResponse *recordspb.BatchGetDocumentResponse\r\n) *types.ExtractedDocumentFields\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Extraction Logic:**\r\n- **DocumentFriendlyID**: Extracted from `document.Meta.ExternalId`\r\n- **AuthorID**: Parsed from `body.meta.authorId` using GJSON\r\n- **OccurrenceDate**: Form-specific extraction (Crash: `crashDate`, GeneralOffense: `dateOfReport`)\r\n- **DocumentCreatedDate**: Retrieved from `document.Meta.CreatedAt`\r\n\r\n### 🗄️ Enhanced `ibr_document` Table Schema\r\n\r\n**New Database Fields:**\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE ibr_document ADD COLUMN:\r\n- document_friendly_id VARCHAR(36)     -- External document identifier\r\n- document_created_at DATETIME(6)      -- Original document creation timestamp  \r\n- occurred_at DATETIME(6)              -- Event occurrence date\r\n- author_id BINARY(16)                 -- Document author UUID\r\n- author_id_str VARCHAR(36) VIRTUAL    -- String representation of author_id\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 💾 Database Read/Write Operations\r\n\r\n**Updated SQL Queries:**\r\n```go\r\n// Enhanced SELECT for all document retrieval methods\r\nSELECT id_str, partner_id_str, created_at, updated_at, document_id_str, \r\n       incident_id_str, incident_friendly_id, incident_date, is_nibrs_compliant, \r\n       can_be_submitted_to_nibrs, submission_id_str, finalized_on, action_code,\r\n       report_type, folder_entity_id_str, folder_entity_type,\r\n       document_friendly_id, document_created_at, occurred_at, author_id_str  -- NEW FIELDS\r\nFROM ibr_document\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Enhanced Write Operations:**\r\n- `buildQueryArgsFromRequest()` - Now handles optional document field insertion\r\n- Conditional field insertion with null-safety checks\r\n- UUID conversion for `author_id` field (string → binary)\r\n\r\n**Affected Methods:**\r\n- ✅ `GetIBRDocument()` - Now returns new document fields\r\n- ✅ `ListIBRDocuments()` - Enhanced SELECT includes new fields  \r\n- ✅ `getIBRDocumentInternal()` - Updated for internal operations\r\n- ✅ `getIBRDocuments()` - Batch retrieval with new fields\r\n\r\n### 🔗 Type System Updates\r\n\r\n**Enhanced Data Structures:**\r\n```go\r\n// Extended IBRDocument struct\r\ntype IBRDocument struct {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Enhanced IBRDocumentRequest\r\ntype IBRDocumentRequest struct {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// New extraction result type\r\ntype ExtractedDocumentFields struct {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🏗️ Integration Flow\r\n\r\n1. **Service Layer**: `NotifyIBRDocument()` → `getBatchDocument()` → `extractDocumentFields()`\r\n2. **Data Extraction**: GJSON parsing of Records Service JSON response\r\n3. **Type Conversion**: Extracted fields → `ExtractedDocumentFields` → `IBRDocumentRequest`\r\n4. **Database Layer**: Enhanced SQL operations with new field handling\r\n5. **Storage**: Binary UUID storage with virtual string columns for queries\r\n\r\n## 🛡️ Error Handling \u0026 Robustness\r\n\r\n- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Missing fields don't block document storage\r\n- **Null-Safe Operations**: All new fields are optional (`*string`, `*time.Time`)\r\n- **Records Service Failures**: Document processing continues if `getBatchDocument()` fails\r\n- **Form-Specific Logic**: Different extraction paths for different document types\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Business Value\r\n\r\n1. **Enhanced Data Richness**: IBR documents now contain full metadata from source records\r\n2. **Audit Trail**: Document creation timestamps and author tracking\r\n3. **Business Intelligence**: Occurrence dates enable better incident analysis\r\n4. **External System Integration**: Document friendly IDs support cross-system references\r\n\r\n## 🔧 Technical Notes\r\n\r\n- **Backward Compatible**: All new fields are optional, existing functionality preserved\r\n- **Performance Optimized**: Virtual columns provide fast string UUID lookups\r\n- **Memory Efficient**: Pointer types prevent unnecessary allocations for null values\r\n- **GJSON Integration**: Fast JSON parsing without full struct unmarshaling\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly enhances the IBR document storage capabilities by bridging Records Service data with the IBRSubmissionSvc database layer, providing richer document metadata for downstream processing and analytics.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n\u003c!-- Describe the tests that you added or modified or ran to verify the changes. --\u003e\r\n\r\n- [ ] manual testing\r\n- [x] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration or e2e tests\r\n\r\n## Does this PR require a CM or document update?\r\n\r\n- [ ] change in any reindexing [script](https://git.taservs.net/rcom/zeke/tree/master/scripts/reindexersvc/reindexer_wrapper.py) might need an update to steps in the [RMS Search Reindexing Runbook](https://axon.quip.com/Bb1UA6Ip5nHd/RMS-Search-Reindexing-Runbook)\r\n- [ ] added or removed a configsvc setting (e.g. feature flag); [the reference table](https://axon.quip.com/DZjWAlGQKNoJ/RMS-Dev-Settings-and-Config-Settings?range_rows=62\u0026range_cols=1#s:MQEACAaTXP1;MQEACA3Uqcc) has been updated.\r\n\r\n## Actions required on deployment\r\n\r\n- [ ] SQL migration\r\n- [ ] Migration script\r\n  -
